Cognitive scientist Don Norman, explains why attractive products work better by using evidence from Psychology, Biology and Neuroscience. He argues that considering the emotional side of a design can improve it. His emphasis on emotion was relatively new at the time, as emotion had previously been disregarded as a by-product of evolution by Psychologists. According to Norman, beautifully designed products shift our mood into happier states which then alters our cognition. He argues ‘happy’ people are more likely to think of creative solutions and tolerate smaller problems. Whereas those in an anxious state tend to focus in on the problem and complain. Creative solutions are important for products as repeating the same action on a computer will yield the same result leading to more user frustration.

Norman goes on to suggest that emotional design is based on three levels of processing in our brain. The ‘visceral’ level which is a automatic unconscious response involves whether we like the products smell, sound, feel, look. The second level ‘behavioural’ measures the performance, usability and the function of the product. The third level ‘reflective’ is conscious unlike the other two and it involves memories and the meaning the user attaches to the product. Our interaction with a product triggers different neurotransmitters which in turn affects our visceral, behaviour and reflective experience. It is up to the designer to consider which emotion is important for the successful use of a product. If a task requires creative thinking -- this can be achieved by using better aesthetics. However, if using the product successfully requires focus and attention to detail, a more neutral or negative emotion should be harnessed. The difficulty comes because taste is subjective, this is largely due to the behavioural and reflective levels of emotions being shaped by our experiences.

**My Reflection**

Norman’s belief that the ‘look and feel’ of a product can improve its usability has had a significant influence in the world of business and design. A real-world example of the phenomena is Apple’s first version of its smartwatch. It had many functionality issues; however, this did not stop the company from achieving the second largest revenue in watch history. There are also many studies that corroborate the effect. One example being Moshagen et al. ( 2009), who created four websites that differed in visual aesthetics (ranging from low to high). They then measured performance by looking at speed and the error rate of a search task. They found that high visual aesthetics enhanced user performance even when there was poor usability.  Norman’s belief that cognition and emotion work in tandem is based on Cognitive psychology. Estrada et al. (1994) found that physicians who had a positive affect (as they had been given sweets), performed better in a creative problem-solving task. However, the exact process behind this phenomenon remains to be investigated.

Norman, also concedes in the chapter that individual differences between populations makes it hard to consider how emotions can help us design. A good approach can be that we should first think about designing products that do not have usability issues. Once this is achieved the aesthetics should also be considered because a beautiful design can foster creative thinking in the user and can compensate for usability issues. One fundamental point to take away from this chapter is that the designer should always accommodate both emotional and cognitive components of a design. Attending to functionality as well as the three aspects of emotional design which formulate aesthetically pleasing objects can be difficult, but that is what makes design a creative as well as a scientific process.

I learnt a lot from running a study with participants who are Blind. Ensuring materials were accessible, using language that did not rely on vision, and even something as simple as offering mobility assistance is not something that I have been required to think about in previous studies. As someone who does not have a visual impairment, I was never sure that the procedures and tasks that I was drafting would work in real life. Which is why having Harsha involved in the study was so beneficial. I could always run things through with Harsha who provided a lot of useful tips such as how to guide someone when you need to open a door at the same time. Before the study began, we learnt about disability in Inclusive Design and it made me think deeper about the implicit biases we have and the assumptions we make without even knowing, and I did not want to carry this on to the study. I have learnt when you are approaching a study where you are an outsider it is great to do research beforehand but it is best to listen and learn from those who are from the community.

I liked ensuring all the materials and tasks asked of the participants were accessible as it made room for creative thinking. For example, we were able to mitigate the inaccessibility of the NASA-TLX by creating a scale that worked using tactile senses. I learnt that if something is inaccessible because of a disability, then we should be asking, what senses or workarounds do they use in their everyday lives? And how can we leverage these skills to ensure that they can complete a task you are asking them to do.

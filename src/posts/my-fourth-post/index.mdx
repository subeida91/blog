My favourite book this year has been Range by David Epstein subtitled why generalists succeed in a world full of specialists. He highlights how we are obsessed with the idea of a  ‘child genius’ who excels in a skill from an early age, and then grows up to working and dominating this field. When in reality, people like Mozart are known because this event rarely happens. 

He also argues we should stop narrowing the pipeline and deselecting people just because they haven’t achieved something they will eventually learn or grown into like reading. Why does it matter who learns to read first when eventually we will all be able to read? Or we can think about the child who is bilingual but is behind in class where they are only being tested for English. We might think they are not able to pick up languages easily but their ability to speak two different languages probably make them better at understanding the structure of language. You might see the monolingual speaker under performing in tests where exposure to more languages takes you over the finishing line.
